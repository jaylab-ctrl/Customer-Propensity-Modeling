## Business Problem 
With the increasing demands of customers, companies have shifted towards various online
platforms. Every day, a number of people visit a particular website, but only a small percentage
of them actually make a purchase, and some of them may never even return. The customers are
not loyal to the brands anymore, what they really want is the best product value for their money.
Wherever they get a better offer they will purchase the product from there. So, it is very difficult
to predict customer behavior. A system can be generated to predict customer behavior and
identify the most valuable opportunities and build strategies by targeting the visitors who are
more likely to convert into customers who will help to maximize company’s revenue and
accelerate its growth.

To tackle this problem, I along with my team mates are developing an end-to-end Propensity Modelling as a Service (PMaaS) software that consists of four different models: Propensity to Churn, Propensity to Engage, Customer Satisfaction, and Customer Lifetime Value, that will cater small businesses to make data-driven-decisions, targeting each segment of every customer.

## Domain Introduction
Data science is the domain of study that deals with enormous amounts of data using cutting-edge
tools and methods to uncover hidden patterns, glean valuable information, and make business
decisions. Data science creates predictive models using sophisticated machine learning
algorithms. \
As the solution for the above problem statement, we have decided to do Customer Propensity
Modeling on the dataset. Propensity Models allow managers and analysts to identify
potential customer opportunities in various groups of users and to improve user
engagement. Propensity scores can be also directly used to create better marketing
campaigns and targeting which will ultimately increase sales. It also reduces spending
while ensuring better and faster decision-making. \
For companies to be good with predictions, propensity models have to be dynamic, scalable, and
adaptive.

- Dynamic means models should be built in a way to advance with trends, adapt, and learn
on new data as it becomes available.
- Scalable means they shouldn’t be created for a single-use scenario but in a way to
produce a wide array of predictions.
- Adaptive means models should have a proper data pipeline for regular data ingestion,
validation, and deployment to timely adjust to changes.


## Data source
The data was collected from Kaggle.
